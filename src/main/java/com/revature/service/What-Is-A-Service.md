## Service Layer
The Service Layer is meant to handle "Business Rules". These are constraints/requirements from a 3rd party
(typically the individual(s) or company you are building the application for) that are not program specific.
For instance, a business rule that users of the app can't share the same username. There is nothing specific in Java that prevents this from happening, so you as the creator would have to work the rule into the app. This is done in the "Service Layer".
